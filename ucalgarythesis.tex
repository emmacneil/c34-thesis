\begin{thesisabstract}  

Computing in the divisor class group of an algebraic curve is a non-trivial component in computing $L$-series.
$L$-series in turn are at the heart of the Sato-Tate conjecture and related conjectures.
The Sato-Tate conjecture has been proven for elliptic curves with complex multiplication,
but remains open for other families of algebraic curves.
In order to test these conjectures against other curve families, it is desirable to have efficient algorithms to perform divisor class group arithmetic.

Fast explicit formulas exist to perform divisor class group arithmetic for genus 1 and genus 2 curves.
However, the picture for genus 3 curves is incomplete.
Existing explicit formulas for arithmetic on non-hyperelliptic genus 3 curves ($C_{3,4}$ curves) have been developed with cryptographic applications in mind.
They make certain generacity assumptions on their inputs that hold with high probability in cryptographic settings,
but are unsuited for number theoretic use cases.
More general algorithms exist that can perform divisor class arithmetic over any curve, but they are slow.
The goal of this project is to bridge the gap --
to find fast explicit formulas describing $C_{3,4}$ curve arithmetic that are correct for all inputs.

  \chapter{Acknowledgements}  
  
Thank you to my family.
Your thoughts, prayers, and support were felt 4,500 km away.

Thank you to my supervisors, Dr. Renate Scheidler and Dr. Michael Jacobson.
Your expertise in class group computations helped me get this project started.
Your expertise in time management helped me finish.

Thank you to my fellow graduate students and officemates.
Randy Yee, who poked holes in my proofs like a mathematical awl.
Without you, the proofs in this thesis would look awfully stupid.
Sumin Leem, who was always happy to help.
Your experience with function fields was invaluable to my early understanding of curves.
Geoff Vooys, who always had a different perspective on a problem and three references.
When I was stuck on something, your take always led somewhere fruitful.

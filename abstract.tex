Computing in the divisor class group of an algebraic curve is a non-trivial component in computing $L$-series.
$L$-series in turn are at the heart of the Sato-Tate conjecture and related conjectures.
The Sato-Tate conjecture has been proven for elliptic curves with complex multiplication,
but remains open for other families of algebraic curves.
In order to test these conjectures against other curve families, it is desirable to have efficient algorithms to perform divisor class group arithmetic.

Fast explicit formulas exist to perform divisor class group arithmetic for genus 1 and genus 2 curves.
However, the picture for genus 3 curves is incomplete.
Existing explicit formulas for arithmetic on non-hyperelliptic genus 3 curves ($C_{3,4}$ curves) have been developed with cryptographic applications in mind.
They make certain generacity assumptions on their inputs that hold with high probability in cryptographic settings,
but are unsuited for number theoretic use cases.
More general algorithms exist that can perform divisor class arithmetic over any curve, but they are slow.
